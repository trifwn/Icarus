# ICARUS CLI Component Relationships

This document describes the relationships between the major components of the ICARUS CLI system.

## Core Components

### Application Framework

The Application Framework is the foundation of the CLI system and provides the following:

- Application lifecycle management
- Screen and widget management
- Event handling and routing
- Configuration management
- Session state management

**Key Classes:**
- `IcarusCLI`: Main application controller
- `ScreenManager`: Manages screen transitions and navigation
- `EventSystem`: Handles event routing and processing
- `ConfigManager`: Manages application configuration
- `SessionManager`: Manages user session state

**Relationships:**
- The `IcarusCLI` class is the entry point for the application and coordinates all other components
- `ScreenManager` is responsible for managing the UI screens and transitions
- `EventSystem` provides communication between components
- `ConfigManager` provides access to application configuration
- `SessionManager` maintains user session state

### User Interface

The User Interface layer is built on the Textual framework and provides:

- Screen components for different application features
- Widget library for common UI elements
- Theme system for visual customization
- Layout engine for responsive UI

**Key Classes:**
- `BaseScreen`: Base class for all screens
- `Dashboard`: Main dashboard screen
- `AnalysisScreen`: Screen for configuring and running analyses
- `ResultsScreen`: Screen for displaying analysis results
- `WorkflowScreen`: Screen for workflow management
- `SettingsScreen`: Screen for application settings

**Relationships:**
- All screens inherit from `BaseScreen` which provides common functionality
- Screens use widgets from the widget library for UI elements
- The theme system provides visual styling for all UI components
- The layout engine ensures proper layout on different terminal sizes

### Analysis Engine

- `ResultProcessor`: Processes analysis results
- `SolverManager`: Manages external solvers

**Relationships:**
- `AnalysisService` provides a unified interface to all analysis capabilities
- `ParameterValidator` ensures analysis parameters are valid
- `ResultProcessor` formats analysis results for display
- `SolverManager` handles integration with external solvers

### Workflow System

The Workflow System enables creation and execution of complex analysis workflows:

- Workflow definition and storage
- Workflow execution engine
- Template management
- Progress tracking

**Key Classes:**
- `WorkflowEngine`: Main engine for workflow execution
- `WorkflowBuilder`: Visual workflow builder
- `WorkflowTemplate`: Template for common workflows
- `WorkflowExecutor`: Executes workflow steps

**Relationships:**
- `WorkflowEngine` coordinates workflow creation and execution
- `WorkflowBuilder` provides UI for creating workflows
- `WorkflowTemplate` provides templates for common workflows
- `WorkflowExecutor` executes individual workflow steps

### Data Management

The Data Management system handles data storage and retrieval:

- Structured database for analyses and results
- Import/export capabilities
- Version control for analysis history
- Backup and recovery

**Key Classes:**
- `DataManager`: Main data management service
- `DatabaseAdapter`: Interface to database backend
- `ImportExportService`: Handles data import/export
- `VersionManager`: Manages version history

**Relationships:**
- `DataManager` provides a unified interface to data management
- `DatabaseAdapter` handles database operations
- `ImportExportService` handles data exchange with external systems
- `VersionManager` tracks changes to data over time

### Collaboration System

The Collaboration System enables real-time collaboration:

- Session sharing
- State synchronization
- User management
- Communication

**Key Classes:**
- `CollaborationService`: Main collaboration service
- `SessionSharing`: Handles session sharing
- `StateSynchronizer`: Synchronizes state between users
- `UserManager`: Manages user accounts and permissions

**Relationships:**
- `CollaborationService` coordinates collaboration features
- `SessionSharing` enables sharing sessions with other users
- `StateSynchronizer` keeps state in sync between users
- `UserManager` handles user authentication and permissions

### Plugin System

The Plugin System enables extending the CLI with custom functionality:

- Plugin API
- Plugin discovery and loading
- Plugin management
- Sandboxing and security

**Key Classes:**
- `PluginManager`: Main plugin management service
- `PluginLoader`: Loads and initializes plugins
- `PluginAPI`: API for plugin development
- `PluginSandbox`: Secure execution environment for plugins

**Relationships:**
- `PluginManager` coordinates plugin discovery and management
- `PluginLoader` handles loading and initializing plugins
- `PluginAPI` provides interfaces for plugin development
- `PluginSandbox` ensures plugins run in a secure environment

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

The Security system ensures data protection and secure operations:

- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption
- Audit logging
- Plugin security

**Key Classes:**
- `SecurityManager`: Main security service
- `AuthenticationService`: Handles user authentication
- `EncryptionService`: Handles data encryption
- `AuditLogger`: Logs security-relevant events

### Error Handling

The Error Handling system provides robust error management:

- Centralized error handling
- Error classification
- Recovery strategies
- Error logging

**Key Classes:**
- `ErrorHandler`: Central error handling service
- `ErrorClassifier`: Classifies errors by type
- `RecoveryManager`: Implements recovery strategies
- `ErrorLogger`: Logs errors for debugging

### Performance Optimization

The Performance Optimization system ensures efficient operation:
