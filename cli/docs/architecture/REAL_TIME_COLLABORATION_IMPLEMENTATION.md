## Usage Examples

### Starting a Collaborative Session

```python
from collaboration.collaboration_manager import CollaborationManager

# Initialize collaboration
manager = CollaborationManager()
await manager.start()

# Create session
session = manager.create_session(
    owner=user,
    name="Wing Analysis Session",
    session_type=SessionType.ANALYSIS
)

# Start recording
recording = await manager.start_recording(session.id, user.id)
```

### Real-time Parameter Synchronization

```python
# Sync parameter change across all participants
await manager.sync_state_change(
    session_id=session.id,
    user=user,
    change_type="PARAMETER_CHANGE",
    path="analysis.mesh_density",
    old_value=0.1,
    new_value=0.2
)
```

### Conflict Resolution

```python
# Automatic conflict detection and resolution
success = await manager.detect_and_resolve_conflicts(
    session_id, conflicting_changes
)

# Manual resolution with specific strategy
await manager.resolve_conflict_manually(
    conflict_id, ResolutionStrategy.OWNER_PRIORITY, user_id
)
```

## Future Enhancements

While all required features have been implemented, potential future enhancements include:

1. **Advanced Merge Algorithms**: More sophisticated text and data merging
2. **Machine Learning Conflict Prediction**: Predict conflicts before they occur
3. **Enhanced Playback Features**: Timeline scrubbing, event filtering
4. **Mobile Support**: Extend WebSocket support for mobile clients
5. **Integration with External Tools**: CAD software, cloud services
