# ICARUS CLI v2.0 - Restructuring Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview

The ICARUS CLI has been successfully restructured from an inquirer-based system to a modern, stateful, and extensible architecture. This document summarizes what has been accomplished and the current state of the system.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Core Framework Implementation
- **State Management** (`core/state.py`): Complete session persistence, configuration management, and history tracking
- **UI Framework** (`core/ui.py`): Rich theming system, layout management, progress tracking, and notifications
- **Workflow Engine** (`core/workflow.py`): Automated workflows with step-by-step execution and template management
- **Services** (`core/services.py`): Validation, export/import, and reporting services
- **TUI Integration** (`core/tui_integration.py`): Event-driven integration between CLI and TUI

### 2. Enhanced CLI Implementation
- **Main Entry Point** (`enhanced_main.py`): Modern typer-based CLI with rich interface
- **Stateful Sessions**: Persistent state across CLI sessions
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless workflow execution and management
- **TUI Launch**: Integrated TUI mode launch from CLI menu
- **IPython Integration**: Interactive shell with session context

### 3. TUI Framework Structure
- **Widgets** (`tui/widgets/`): Modular widgets for session, workflow, analysis, results, progress, and notifications
- **Utilities** (`tui/utils/`): Helper classes for events, theming, data management, and validation
- **Integration**: Full integration with core framework via event system

### 4. Code Cleanup and Organization
- **Removed Legacy**: Eliminated inquirer dependency and old CLI code
