# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves performing a comprehensive design review and cleanup of the existing JAX airfoil implementation to identify production readiness issues, refactor the testing suite for better coverage and organization, create an extensive demo suite, and organize the JAX implementation codebase. The goal is to ensure the JAX airfoil module is production-ready with clean, maintainable code and comprehensive testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for production deployment, I want to identify and resolve all potential issues in the JAX airfoil implementation, so that the code is production-ready and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN all potential bugs, performance issues, and code quality problems SHALL be identified
2. WHEN code analysis is performed THEN all unused imports, dead code, and redundant implementations SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the implementation is examined THEN all TODO comments and incomplete features SHALL be addressed
4. IF security vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns are found THEN they SHALL be fixed before production deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the test suite, I want the JAX airfoil tests to be well-organized and provide comprehensive coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is refactored THEN it SHALL have clear organization with logical grouping of related tests
2. WHEN test coverage is analyzed THEN it SHALL cover all critical functionality with appropriate edge cases
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL be efficient and avoid redundant or overlapping test cases
4. IF test maintenance is needed THEN the structure SHALL make it easy to add, modify, or remove tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user learning the JAX airfoil functionality, I want comprehensive examples and demonstrations, so that I can understand how to use all features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examples are created THEN they SHALL demonstrate all major JAX airfoil features and use cases
2. WHEN the demo is run THEN it SHALL showcase performance benefits, gradient computation, and batch operations
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear explanations and practical applications
4. IF advanced features are demonstrated THEN they SHALL include optimization workflows and real-world scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the JAX implementation, I want the codebase to be well-organized and maintainable, so that I can easily understand and modify the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code structure is reviewed THEN it SHALL have clear separation of concerns and logical module organization
2. WHEN modules are examined THEN they SHALL have consistent naming conventions and clear interfaces
3. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN they SHALL be minimal and well-justified
4. IF refactoring is needed THEN it SHALL improve code readability and maintainability without breaking functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the JAX airfoil implementation to be optimized for production use, so that it performs efficiently in real-world applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance is analyzed THEN all bottlenecks and inefficiencies SHALL be identified and addressed
2. WHEN memory usage is examined THEN it SHALL be optimized to avoid unnecessary allocations
3. WHEN JIT compilation is tested THEN it SHALL be efficient with minimal recompilation overhead
4. IF performance regressions are found THEN they SHALL be fixed and prevented with appropriate benchmarks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating JAX airfoils into larger systems, I want clear interfaces and robust error handling, so that integration is smooth and debugging is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN APIs are reviewed THEN they SHALL have consistent signatures and clear documentation
2. WHEN error conditions occur THEN they SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery suggestions
3. WHEN integration points are examined THEN they SHALL be well-defined and stable
4. IF breaking changes are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration paths

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation of the JAX airfoil implementation, so that I can verify it meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is performed THEN all functionality SHALL be verified against the original NumPy implementation
2. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without crashes or incorrect results
3. WHEN performance is benchmarked THEN it SHALL meet or exceed the performance targets
4. IF regressions are found THEN they SHALL be documented and addressed before production release

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want clear and comprehensive documentation for the JAX airfoil implementation, so that users can effectively utilize all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL be accurate, complete, and up-to-date
2. WHEN API documentation is examined THEN it SHALL include clear examples and usage patterns
3. WHEN migration guides are provided THEN they SHALL help users transition from the original implementation
4. IF documentation gaps are found THEN they SHALL be filled with appropriate content and examples
