3. WHEN workflows are executed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress tracking and error handling
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports and allow result comparison
5. IF workflow execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and recovery options

### Requirement 5: Data Management and Visualization

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive data management and visualization capabilities, so that I can analyze results, create publications-quality plots, and manage large datasets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL automatically organize and store results in a structured database
2. WHEN users request visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide interactive plotting with customization options
3. WHEN users export data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, HDF5, MATLAB, etc.)
4. WHEN users import data THEN the system SHALL validate and integrate external datasets
5. IF data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide merge resolution tools and backup options

### Requirement 6: Real-time Collaboration Features

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to share analysis sessions and collaborate in real-time, so that my team can work together efficiently on aircraft design projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users start collaboration sessions THEN the system SHALL allow secure session sharing with role-based permissions
2. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL synchronize interface state and analysis results
3. WHEN users make changes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates to all connected participants
4. WHEN collaboration ends THEN the system SHALL save session history and allow individual result export
5. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL maintain local state and resync when connection is restored

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a power user, I want the CLI to handle large-scale analyses and datasets efficiently, so that I can work with complex aircraft configurations and extensive parameter studies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI through asynchronous operations
2. WHEN running batch analyses THEN the system SHALL utilize available CPU cores and provide progress tracking
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching and cleanup strategies
4. WHEN analyses are long-running THEN the system SHALL allow background execution with notification upon completion
5. IF system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL provide resource usage monitoring and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 8: Extensibility and Plugin System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the CLI with custom modules and integrations, so that I can add specialized functionality and connect to external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers create plugins THEN the system SHALL provide a well-documented plugin API with examples
2. WHEN plugins are installed THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and integrate them into the interface
3. WHEN plugins are updated THEN the system SHALL handle version compatibility and migration
4. WHEN plugins have dependencies THEN the system SHALL manage dependency resolution and conflicts
5. IF plugins cause errors THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and provide debugging information

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Personalization

**User Story:** As a regular user, I want to customize the interface layout, themes, and default settings, so that I can optimize my workflow and personal preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access settings THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive customization options for themes, layouts, and behaviors
2. WHEN users modify settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately with preview capabilities
3. WHEN users switch between projects THEN the system SHALL maintain project-specific configurations
